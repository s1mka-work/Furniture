# Furniture
This programm is for counting furniture for windows. 
Now this stuff has input height, width and number of windows and output furniture that will be used for these windows. 
In dependence of height and width, this programm will determine which furniture is needed.
Now this programm is MVP, but I will improve it.
At this time it knows only one type of windows, rotary,
Over time I`ll add there are several types of windows, such as hinged and fixed windows
